## ðŸ§ª Project Overview
Predicted **water potability (drinkable or not)** using attributes such as pH, hardness, TDS, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. Applied six ML algorithms with performance comparison.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
* Earned a **B+ grade**  
* Mastered **Excel, Word, PowerPoint**, and **Orange Data Mining**  
* Strengthened data analysis, visualization, and machine learning skills
